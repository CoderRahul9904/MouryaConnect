# MediaCapture Component

**MouryaConnect - WebRTC Learning Journey**

The **MediaCapture** component is a React (TypeScript) component that demonstrates how to access and display local media (video and audio) using the WebRTC `getUserMedia` API. This component is a core part of the MouryaConnect project and serves as an introductory demo to working with real-time media capture in web applications.

## Features

- **Access Media Devices:** Uses `getUserMedia` to request access to the user's webcam and microphone.
- **Display Local Video:** Renders the live video stream on the page.
- **Error Handling:** Provides basic error handling for cases where media access is denied or fails.
